# Windows Security Policies Parser & Editor

This is a windows security policies parser program written in python using the tkinter library.

### Step 1

To run the program use:
```
    python3 path/to/file/text_policy_editor.py
```

### Step 2

Once the desktop app is running go to: 

`File -> Open_file` 

Open the desired windows policy. It will be opened as parsed JSON file.
Make sure it is the right one. Once sure, go to:

`File -> Export`

There will pop-up a window with check boxes that you will select for subsequent export of them into JSON file.
Now you can open it in the default system explorer and see the chosen policies.

`File -> Save_as_file`

It works same as Export, where the pop up a window to choose files to export. However, in this case, you are able to save files in every wanted format as: `.txt`, `.doc`, `.py`, etc.

### Step 3

When the file is saved, you can `Exit` the `Text Editor` window.

`File -> Exit`

Quit the `Text Editor`
